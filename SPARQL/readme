SPARQL AIDGO

This document explains all SPARQL queries used in the AIDGO ontology pipeline.
Queries are written to work with RDF-Star (RDF★) where required.

Query: Retrieve all alignments

Purpose:
Fetch every alignment instance created in the AIDGO ontology.
Shows which Article 10 requirement maps to which ISO clause and the alignment type.

How it works:
Selects nodes that are of type Alignment and retrieves their associated requirement, clause, and alignment type.

Use case:
Quick overview of all mappings in the dataset.

Query: Retrieve alignments with RDF-Star rationale

Purpose:
Fetch not only the alignment but also the attached rationale stored using RDF-Star embedded triples.

Why SPARQL-Star is needed:
The rationale annotation is attached to an embedded triple.
Only SPARQL★ can extract this metadata.

Use case:
Auditing, provenance tracking, justification for alignments.

Query: Unmapped Article 10 requirements (gap analysis)

Purpose:
Find requirements from Article 10 that do not have any alignment to ISO clauses.

How it works:
Lists all RegulatoryRequirement nodes for which there is no matching Alignment that references them.

Use case:
Gap analysis, completeness evaluation for ontological coverage.

Query: ISO clauses not mapped to any requirement

Purpose:
Find ISO 5259 clauses that do not support any Article 10 requirement.

How it works:
Similar to gap analysis, but checks TechnicalClause entities instead.

Use case:
Identifying irrelevant or unnecessary clauses, or gaps in the legal requirements.

Query: Alignment type distribution

Purpose:
Count how many times each alignment type appears.

How it works:
Groups alignment nodes by alignmentType and counts them.

Use case:
Evaluate mapping quality, understand coverage vs conflict vs partial match distribution.

Query: Retrieve only PartiallySatisfies alignments

Purpose:
List all requirement–clause pairs where the alignment type is PartiallySatisfies.

Why this matters:
Partial satisfaction often indicates areas where ISO provisions do not fully meet the AI Act requirements.

Use case:
Assessment of risk, identifying where extra governance controls are needed.

Query: Search rationale for a keyword

Purpose:
Allows text search over rationale explanations.
Example keyword: “bias”.

How it works:
Uses FILTER(CONTAINS()) to match text inside rationale.

Why SPARQL-Star is needed:
Rationale is stored on an embedded triple.

Use case:
Identify clusters of mappings related to risk, bias, legality concerns, or documentation.

Query: Detailed report for one requirement

Purpose:
Show all mapped clauses, alignment types, and rationales for a specific Article 10 requirement.

How it works:
Filters alignments based on a specific RequirementID.

Use case:
Case study reporting, internal audit, or PhD evaluation demonstration.

Query: Full provenance dump (RDF-Star)

Purpose:
Retrieve all embedded provenance statements stored via RDF-Star in the ontology.

Why SPARQL-Star is required:
All rationale explanations are attached to embedded triples, not standard triples.

How it works:
Searches for every alignment triple and extracts rationale using embedded triple matching.

Use case:
Complete transparency for auditors, regulators, thesis evaluation, or QA processes.
